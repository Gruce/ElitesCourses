## Key components of the internet

The internet is made up of a few key components:

* **Clients** - Clients are computers that request information from servers. They are usually connected to the internet for a short period of time, and they are usually located in homes or offices.

* **Protocols** - Protocols in the language of networking, protocols can be defined as a set of rules that guide data transmission between computing devices. These rules make sure that the data request is sent and received by the client without any problem. The most important internet protocols are â€“ Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP). TCP is responsible for the delivery of data packets from the source to the destination. IP is responsible for the addressing of the data packets.
