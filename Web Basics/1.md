# What is the internet?

## Learning Objectives

* Define the internet
* Explain the difference between the internet and the web
* Identify the key components of the internet

## Introduction

The internet is a global network of computers that connects people and devices all over the world. It's a network of networks, and it's made up of millions of smaller networks, called LANs (local area networks) and WANs (wide area networks). The internet is a collection of these networks, and it's what allows you to connect to the web.


## What is the difference between the internet and the web?

The internet is a network of networks, and the web is a collection of websites. The internet is a network of computers that connects people and devices all over the world.

## Key components of the internet

The internet is made up of a few key components:

* **Servers** - Servers are computers that store information and make it available to other computers on the internet. They are usually connected to the internet 24/7, and they are usually located in data centers.

* **Clients** - Clients are computers that request information from servers. They are usually connected to the internet for a short period of time, and they are usually located in homes or offices.

* **Protocols** - Protocols in the language of networking, protocols can be defined as a set of rules that guide data transmission between computing devices. These rules make sure that the data request is sent and received by the client without any problem. The most important internet protocols are â€“ Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP). TCP is responsible for the delivery of data packets from the source to the destination. IP is responsible for the addressing of the data packets.

## Types of Protocols

1. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
For communicating over a network
2. Internet Protocol (IP)
Addressing protocol
3. User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
Substitute communication protocol
4. Post office Protocol (POP)
For receiving incoming E-mails
5. Simple mail transport Protocol (SMTP)
Designed to send and distribute outgoing E-Mail
6. File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
To transfer files from one machine to another
7. Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
Designed for transferring a hypertext among two or more systems
8. Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)
Secured HTTP
9. Telnet
For connecting one system with another
10. Gopher
For searching, retrieving as well as displaying documents from isolated sites

There are other protocols as well, but these are the most important ones.

### HTTP Protocol

HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance, text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.

#### HTML: HyperText Markup Language

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as `<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>` ,`<header>` ,`<footer>` ,`<article>` ,`<section>` ,`<p>` ,`<div>` ,`<span>` ,`<img>` ,`<aside>` ,`<audio>` ,`<canvas>` ,`<datalist>` ,`<details>` ,`<embed>` ,`<nav>` ,`<output>` ,`<progress>` ,`<video>` ,`<ul>` ,`<ol>` ,`<li>` and many others.

#### CSS: Cascading Style Sheets

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

#### JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design / program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an event. JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting language, widely used for controlling web page behavior.


## Conclusion

The internet is a global network of computers that connects people and devices all over the world. It's a network of networks, and it's made up of millions of smaller networks, called LANs (local area networks) and WANs (wide area networks). The internet is a collection of these networks, and it's what allows you to connect to the web.
