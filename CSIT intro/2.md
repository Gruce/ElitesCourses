# Let's Play!

## What is sketch?

sketch is a program that make a drawing on a screen.

## Draw shapes

- [`point(x, y)`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/point): Draws a single point at position `x`, `y`
- [`line(x1, y1, x2, y2)`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/line): Draws a line from `x1`, `y1` to `x2`, `y2`.
- [`ellipse(x, y, w, h)`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/ellipse): Like a circle, except draws an ellipse with the given width: `w` and height: `h`.
- [`square(x, y, s)`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/square): Draws a square at position `x`, `y` with size `s`
- [`rect(x, y, w, h)`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/rect): Draws a rectangle at position `x`, `y` with width `w` and height `h`.
- [`triangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/triangle): Draws a triangle with corners at points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3)

## Colors

In the digital world, when we want to talk about a color, precision is  required. Saying "Hey, can you make that circle bluish-green?" will not  do. Color, rather, is defined as a range of numbers. Let's start with  the simplest case: black & white or grayscale. 0 means black, 255  means white. In between, every other number—50, 87, 162, 209, and so  on—is a shade of gray ranging from black to white. 

```javascript
background(255);    // Setting the background to white
stroke(0);          // Setting the outline (stroke) to 
```

- Red + Green = Yellow
- Red + Blue = Purple
- Green + Blue = Cyan (blue-green)
- Red + Green + Blue = White
- No colors = Black

## Conditionals & Interactivety

we can easily make our sketches respond to mouse input by using some of the built-in events and variables

```js
if (mouseIsPressed){    circle(mouseX, mouseY, 10);  }
```

## Loops

you can use a `for` statement to produce repeating loops. The general form of a for loop is shown in the following diagram
